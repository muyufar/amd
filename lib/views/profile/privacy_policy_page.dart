Additionally, in some situations, we may also store additional metadata such as the last login time, device used, or IP address. The purpose of this is to maintain the security of your account, detect suspicious activity, and improve system performance.

4. HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US?
We use the information we collect for various important purposes, with the main goal of ensuring that the Ebook AMD service functions optimally, securely, and in accordance with your needs as a user. Here is a detailed explanation of each use of data:

1. Managing User Accounts and Authentication Processes

We use personal information such as your email and name for:

Create, identify, and verify registered user accounts.
Manage the login process, either via email or third-party services such as Google.
Store account preferences, transaction history, and subscription status so you can securely access your data across multiple devices.
Maintain account security from suspicious activity or unauthorized access through an encrypted authentication system.
2. Processing Payments and Digital Transactions through Midtrans

We utilize Midtrans payment services to process your transactions securely and efficiently. Data such as payment amount, transaction status, order ID, and transaction time are used to:

Confirm your payment.
Provide direct access to the eBooks you have purchased.
Track and resolve payment issues if any problems arise.
All payment data is managed in accordance with Midtrans' security policies, and we do not store sensitive information such as debit/credit card numbers on our servers.
3. Providing Access to Purchased eBooks

After a successful transaction, we use your data to:

Link purchased eBooks to your account.
Ensure that only authorized users (who have purchased) can access paid content.
Provide a bookshelf feature so you can access your eBooks again whenever you need them.

5. HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN YOUR DATA?
We are committed to storing your personal data only for as long as necessary to support service operations, fulfill legal obligations, and maintain system security. Data retention periods vary depending on the type of data and the purpose for which it was collected.

In general, we will store your personal data for:
Your account is still active or you are still using our services.
As long as your account is active, data such as user profiles, transaction history, eBook collections, and account settings will continue to be stored so that you can access our services without interruption.

As long as it is necessary to fulfill legal and administrative obligations.
Some data (e.g., transaction records, proof of payment, and system activity logs) must be stored to comply with tax regulations, audits, dispute resolution, or fraud prevention.

After the account is deleted.
When you close or delete your account, we will delete or anonymize most of your personal data within a reasonable time. However, we may retain certain data—such as transaction history, security data, or proof of payment—for up to 5 (five) years for legal, security, and internal record-keeping purposes.

Data that is no longer relevant will be deleted or anonymized.
After the retention period ends, all personal data will be permanently deleted or anonymized so that it cannot be used to identify any individual.

We implement strict security procedures throughout the entire data storage and deletion process to ensure that your data is protected from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.

6. DO WE SHARE YOUR DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES?
We do not sell, rent, or exchange your personal data to any third parties. However, we may share some data with trusted third parties who assist in the operation of Ebook AMD services, provided that they also comply with equivalent security and privacy standards.

We only share data in the following contexts:
Log in via Google (Google OAuth).
If you use the Google login method, we will receive basic data from your Google account such as your name, email address, and profile photo in accordance with the permission you give us. This data is only used for authentication and account creation on the Ebook AMD platform. We do not have access to your Google password and do not share your data back with Google unless it is necessary for authentication.

Payment Processing via Midtrans.
For eBook transactions, we work with Midtrans as our payment service provider. In this process, we may share relevant data such as transaction ID, buyer email address, payment amount, and payment status so that Midtrans can verify and process your transaction securely. Midtrans is required to maintain the confidentiality of this data and will not use it outside the context of your transaction on Ebook AMD.

Legal compliance.
We may disclose personal data if required by law, court proceedings, or official requests from authorized government agencies.

7. WHAT APP FEATURES AND PERMISSIONS DO WE USE?
The Ebook AMD application requires several features and permissions from your device to function optimally. We only request permissions that are absolutely necessary to provide our services, and each permission is used for a specific purpose.

Here is a list of features and permissions that our application can use:
Internet Access
Used to connect the application to the Ebook AMD server, load eBook content, perform login, checkout, and payment transactions through Midtrans.

Google Account Access
Used for the Google login process (Google OAuth). The data collected is limited to your name, email, and profile photo according to the permissions you grant. We do not have access to your Google account password or other personal data.

Ebook AMD is always committed to using every permission responsibly and transparently. There are no hidden features, location tracking, or access to personal data without the user's explicit permission.

8. SECURITY OF DATA AND ENCRYPTED CONNECTIONS
We protect user data security by using modern encryption standards (HTTPS/SSL) in all communications between the Ebook AMD application, our servers, and third-party services such as Midtrans and Google. All data sent, including login information, transactions, and eBook access, is protected with an encrypted connection so that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.

However, we would like to transparently convey that:
All main Ebook AMD URLs use HTTPS (encrypted).
Every API request, login process, and transaction runs through a secure connection (https://). We do not use or provide unencrypted http:// URLs for public services.

Midtrans and Google Login also use encrypted connections (TLS/SSL).
All data exchanges with third parties take place over secure channels in accordance with industry standards.

Warning for users:
We advise users to always ensure that they access the official Ebook AMD website via a secure connection (https://) and not to share their credentials on unknown third-party websites or applications.

In short: all communications involving personal data, transactions, or authentication on Ebook AMD always use full encryption.
